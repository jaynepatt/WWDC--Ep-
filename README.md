# WWDC/ App, "Ep"

### "E"motion "P"icture
Human emotions are similar to each other but exist abstractly in different meanings.
Some emotions fall from the sky like rain, and some emotions erupt from deep inside and some emotions bloom in the heart.
However, emotions are trapped in a space called "words" and delivered to others.

Therefore, words expressing emotions are convenient in expressing my mind, but it is difficult to explain the subtle difference.
In this Gaeun's WWDC, "Happy", "Scared", "Calm", "Bored", "Angry", and "Sad" were peeled and expressed in terms of "hearing" and "visual" elements.
It's a shame that it seems to express only a part of the meaning of each emotion, but I hope you enjoy using the app.

### Happy
I wanted to express that happy comes to life every moment in a different shape.
Through the animation of SWiftUI, various bubbles were implemented to appear randomly.

### Scared
I think scared begins by imagining the whole that is not yet visible through the part that is now visible.
A black screen is displayed with dreary music, and only a part of the picture can be checked with a small circle that the user can see by touching.

### Calm
People would feel comfortable when all goes as planned in me like water.
So water is flowing, expressed comfort, using the animation.
It also expressed the feelings of people who want to continue to feel comfortable in a changing environment in the shape of a container for water.

### Bored
People keep checking their watches when they feel bored, hoping that time flies. So I put the clock right in the middle of the screen.
In addition, they are overwhelmed by difficult contents and bored thinking, "Why am I here?" These people have been likened to astronauts swimming in outer space.

### Angry
Usually, anger is the emotion that overflows with something.
But I wanted to express the fluctuating emotions that piled up before that rather than the boiling anger.
So as the user drags the screen, red water fluctuates on the screen and piles up to a darker color.

### Sad
I've seen a lot of people who calm down their emotions alone when they feel sad.
So, I composed a sadness screen thinking of those who had time alone and comforted their sadness.
